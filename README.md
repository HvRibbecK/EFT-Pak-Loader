# EFT-Pak-Loader
Simple EFT Pak Loader. This is the only and last version I will commit from this loader. It was my first Version, use it as a template or whatever. In order to use it, you need to change all the 'CHANGEME' lines in the project, just use Ctrl+F. This version is behind the current build, but it works as a start for other users.

Since it is the first version, it can be used but could be improved.

## Commercial use
Contact me if you want to use it for commercial use.

## How to use
Go into the code and search for 'CHANGEME'. You'll see a instruction in the line on what to change.
NOTE: You only need to change those lines to make it work, however, it wont be improved by that way.
